# Google-Scholar-Network-Analysis
In this project we aim to analyse Google Scholar network to find the scientific collaboration between authors, depicting how individual scientific ideas of authors can get together through collaboration to cause an explosion of scientific findings. 

 The entire working of our algorithms can be divided into four main modules. 
 1. WebScrapping
 2. Network ploting
 3. Network Analysis
 4. Result Visualization
